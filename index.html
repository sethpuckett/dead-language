        Sick of flashcards? Can't stay awake for your Spanish 101 podcast? Then Dead Language is just what you need! Who says learning a new language needs to be a chore? Dead Language combines fast-paced, zombie blasting mayhem and Spanish language review in one mind-melting edu-tainment package! It's loaded with games to help you practice vocab, spelling, conjugation, grammar, reading comprehension, and more! And all while dispensing righteous, gory justice to legions of undead abominations.
      </p>
      <p>
        ...That's the plan anyway. Dead Language is still in the early stages of development, but I'm adding new things every day. Check back for more updates!

        The rules right now are pretty simple: Zombies march down the screen. Each zombie has an associated English word. Type the Spanish translation and hit Enter to blast 'em. If a zombie makes it to the bottom they will attack. Take too many hits and it's Game Over.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game has a lot of shortcomings for now. It doesn't work at all on mobile. There's a set list of only around 100 vocab words, and each one has exactly one translation. Eventually I will add support for synonyms, as well as study guides and multiple levels with various difficulties. But one step at a time here.

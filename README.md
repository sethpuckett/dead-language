## Developer Notes
An http server is needed to run locally. I recommend [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
```bash
$ npm install http-server -g
```

To start the server run `http-server` from the project directory.
```bash
$ http-server
Starting up http-server, serving ./
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
  http://192.168.0.5:8080
  http://10.9.1.227:8080
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```
